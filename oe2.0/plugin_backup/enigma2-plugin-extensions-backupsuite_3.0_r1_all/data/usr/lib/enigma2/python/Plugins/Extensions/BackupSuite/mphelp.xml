	<page title="\c0000??00Green button:\tBackup > HDD\c00??????">
		<text value="This option enables you to make a backup directly to your hard disk or hard disk replacement such as a NAS.\n\nWhen creating a backup to your hard disk it is also possible to copy an extra copy of your backup onto an USB-stick ready to use to restore the backup.\nTherefore you'll have to place an USB-stick into one of the USB-slots. \nThere is however one important condition you'll have to fulfil and that is that there \c00??0000MUST\c00?????? be a file on the USB-stick with the name &quot;backupstick&quot; or &quot;backupstick.txt&quot;.\nWith this file you're saying it is OK to make a backup onto this USB-stick.

	<page title="\c00????00Yellow button:\tBackup > USB\c00??????">
		<text value="This option enables you to make a backup directly to an USB-stick. To be able to make a successful backup onto an USB-stick you'll have to meet these requirements:\n- The USB-stick has to be FAT formatted;\n- There must be enough room on the USB-stick\n   (about 3 times the size of the image);\n- On the USB-stick there has to be a file in the root directory \n   with the name &quot;backupstick&quot; or &quot;backupstick.txt&quot;\n\nIt doesn't matter if the name is in lowercase or UPPERCASE or even a mix of both, so &quot;BaCKuPStIcK&quot; is also a valid name."/>

		<text value="This option enables you to make a backup directly to your MultiMediaCard.\n\nWhen creating a backup to your MultiMediaCard it is also possible to copy an extra copy of your backup onto an USB-stick ready to use to restore the backup.\nTherefore you'll have to place an USB-stick into one of the USB-slots. \nThere is however one important condition you'll have to fulfil and that is that there \c00??0000MUST\c00?????? be a file on the USB-stick with the name &quot;backupstick&quot; or &quot;backupstick.txt&quot;.\nWith this file you're saying it is OK to make a backup onto this USB-stick.

	<page title="\c0000????Blue button:\tRestore backup\c00??????">
		<text value="This option enables you to flash a backup or even flash a complete new image from one of your mounted devices, this can be a hard disk, NAS, MultiMediaCard or even an USB-stick.\n\nJust navigate with the file browser to your desired image or backup and start the flash procedure with the green button.\nAfter pressing the green button you first get a warning:\n&quot;Use at your own risk! Make always a backup before use! etc. &quot;\nAfter pressing OK you're adviced if the right files to flash are found and you'll have to choose the parameter to start the real flash procedure.\n\nThe parameter you normally would use to restore your backup or to flash a new image is the option: \n&quot;\c00??0000Standard (root and kernel)\c00??????&quot;\n\nAfter choosing this option you will get a message that the image will freeze and not respond during the flash procedure. The progress bar is shown after some seconds and at the end the system will reboot and start your flashed image.\n\nIt is also possible to unpack an image which is stored in a zip file and flash it after unpacking. This can be done with the yellow button in the restore part of the plugin"/>

	<page title="Some information about the backups made.">
		<text value="All backups are made in at least 3 different places for three the backup options (\c0000??00Backup > HDD\c00??????, \c00????00Backup > USB\c00?????? and \c0000??00Backup > MMC\c00??????). \n\nThe first place is a sort of archive where you can find all your backups and the other place is in the folder with the name which is used when you flash an image from USB. \n\nI will try to explain it a bit, for this example we choose the Xtrend ET9500 and the backup is made let's say on July 4th 2014 on 23.55 hrs. \n\nOne copy of the backup is made in the folders:\n/fullbackup_et9x00/20140704_2355/et9x00.\nThe other copy is made in the folder /et9x00.\n\nIf the backup option &quot;Backup > HDD&quot; is used AND a valid USB-stick is inserted in one of the USB-slots then an extra backup is made on the USB-stick in the folder /et9x00. So this USB-stick is ready to flash/restore the backup in case of troubles. \n\nBe sure you have always a working backup on USB-stick. If your receiver crashes it is not always possible to flash your receiver via the BackupSuite!\n\nPlease remember: The Xtrend receivers are (at the moment?) not capable to flash an image bigger than ~120MB via the USB method, bigger images have to be flashed via the online flash utility ofgwrite (as provided with the BackupSuite via the blue button!)"/>
